Cloudflare ip changer telegram bot

Hey, Welcome to this telegram bot. You can use this bot to directly manage your dns records on Cloudflare. So let's start!

I've created a Telegram bot that allows you to easily change the IP address of your Cloudflare subdomain. This bot uses the Cloudflare API to update your DNS record with the new IP address.
To get started, you'll need to host the bot on your own server. You can do this by downloading the code and hosting it on your server using PHP. Once you have the bot hosted on your server, you'll need to set up a Telegram bot and obtain an API token.
To use the bot, simply send a message to the bot with the new IP address you want to use. The bot will then update your Cloudflare DNS record with the new IP address.
To make the bot work, you'll need to point your Telegram webhook to the main.php file on your server. This file contains the code that handles incoming messages and updates the Cloudflare DNS record.
If you have any questions or run into any issues with the bot, feel free to contact me for support.
